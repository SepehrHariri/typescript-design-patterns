/**
 * Composite Design Pattern.
 *
 * This pattern allows us to compose different objects into a tree structure
 * and then treat the objects uniformly. In other words, we can treat a group of
 * object the same way as a single object.
 *
 * In this example, we are going to build a tree of employees in an organization.
 * An organization may contain many departments and the departments may contain
 * other departments and also employees. By using this pattern we want to get the
 * information and revenue of whole organization (departments + employees).
 *
