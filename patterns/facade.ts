/**
 * Facade Design Pattern
 * This pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
 * This pattern is useful for when a library or a class has some complexities
 * in order to be uses. Facade pattern hides those complexities in itself and
 * provides an interface to use that library or class.
 * In this example we want to simplify using a sms library by using Facade pattern.

 * This content is inspired by:

/**
 * Facade Class
 * Facade class constructs the desired object within itself and provides a simple
 * interface for the client to use that object. Facade also manages the lifecycle
 * of the object.

   * The send method only takes the required arguments from the client.
   * The complexities of initializing and constructing the SMS library are never
