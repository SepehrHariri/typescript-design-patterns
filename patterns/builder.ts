/**
 * Builder Design Pattern.
 * This pattern allows us to construct a complex objects step by step. Builder
 * is useful for when we want to construct an object that needs a lot of
 * customization before creation. So Instead of relying on functions with huge
 * list of parameters to customize the objects, we use builder pattern that lets
 * us build and customize the objects step by step in a cleaner way.
 *
 * SQL Query Builder is one of the most common use cases of Builder pattern. So
 * in this example we are going to create a SQL query builder using Builder Pattern.
 * This content is inspired by:
