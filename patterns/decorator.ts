/**
 * Decorator Design Pattern
 *
 * This pattern allows us to attach new behaviors to an existing object
 * at run-time without changing their classes and relying on sub-classing. Each
 * behavior is defined in a distinct class called decorator and will wrap the
 * intended object to add the behavior to that.
 *
 * In this example we have a hotel and rooms with basic specifications. We want
 * to add behaviors to rooms on demand.
 *
 * This content is inspired by:
