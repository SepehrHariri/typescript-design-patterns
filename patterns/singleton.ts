/**
 * Singleton Design Pattern.
 * This pattern ensures that a class only has one instance throughout the
 * program and provides a method to get that instance.
 *
 * In this example we want to make a class for accessing application configuration
 * variables.
 * Assuming that this class loads whole variables from several distinct config
 * files on local file-system and remote server, this could be a heavy operation
 * and will slow down the application if the clients try to instantiate this
 * class every time they need the variables.
 * By applying Singleton pattern to this problem, we can load the config files
 * only once, cache them and then return same result for the later usages.
 *
 * This content is inspired by:
